## Features

Transparent Twitch Chat is a user script that becomes active when you go into **Theater mode**.

- Chat size and opacity are customizable
- Individual badges can be turned off for clarity
- Username colors are brighter

## How to Install

1. Make sure you have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Edge, Opera) installed in your browser
2. Visit [TransparentTwitchChat.user.js](https://github.com/chylex/Transparent-Twitch-Chat/raw/master/dist/TransparentTwitchChat.user.js) to prompt the install

### Changing the Settings

In order to change settings, at the moment you will have to edit [these lines in the source code](https://github.com/chylex/Transparent-Twitch-Chat/blob/master/src/main.js#L21-L28). You will unfortunately lose your settings when the script is updated, but the next update will have a proper Settings dialog!
